This is my project from university \n
In short: creating a Pac-man clone with limitations in technology

The project has many limitations, incliuded in the 2223S_GUI_PRO2.pdf file

How to start: Run the code from file IntroMenu.java

While ingame, you can use the compound keyboard shortcut - Ctrl+Shift+Q to get back to Menu
